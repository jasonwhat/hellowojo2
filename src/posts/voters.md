The Biden primary win appears inexplicable at first glance. He had no signature policy, [pledged to veto](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/10/biden-says-he-wouldd-veto-medicare-for-all-as-coronavirus-focuses-attention-on-health.html) the most popular and salient policy of the cycle in Medicare for All, barely campaigned and built a [minuscule field operation](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/26/us/politics/joe-biden-california-super-tuesday.html).

> Why do people vote against their interests?

To understand how we got here the better question to ask is **Who votes?**

## Eligible

Turnout can be measured in a few ways, but the most useful groups to home in on are the **Voting Eligible Population (VEP**) and the **Voting Age Population (VAP)**. The VEP is the actual number of US citizens who qualify to register and vote in national elections.

OECD countries tend to use VAP, which paints a less flattering voter record in the US. The US is one of the few countries where VEP is meaningful because of our [racist drive](https://www.aclu.org/blog/voting-rights/racist-roots-denying-incarcerated-people-their-right-vote) to suppress votes of felons.

And while the US voting rate is pretty [abysmal compared to other countries](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/05/21/u-s-voter-turnout-trails-most-developed-countries/), it has been slightly improving since the low-point of the Bill Clinton presidency where the VEP bottomed-out at 51.7%, the lowest turnout rate [since 1924](http://www.electproject.org/national-1789-present).

Clinton and Trump brought out **59.2% of eligible voters** (VEP) and **54.7% measured by VAP**.

## Shift

The loss of voters during Bill Clinton’s terms were the result of a deliberate strategy to gain support of wealthy, more moderate voters in favor of poor and working class votes.

### Voters By Income Level Since 1992

_[Data from the](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9fcb9fdb-36f7-417f-9144-a8780da09952_480x270.gif) \*\*[Roper Center](https://ropercenter.cornell.edu/)_

The above chart shows the success of the Clinton-led mission to transform the Democratic Party to a pro-busines, centrist-friendly political establishment. The shift set the party and overall active voters on a path to domination by those with higher incomes.

We can see the effect more pronounced by zooming in on 1992 and 2000 income levels of voters.

![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbb245ce4-4f6a-4df3-a113-4aaf79e06192_982x575.png)

When Bill Clinton was first elected he won with a large majority of lower income voters and there was near parity between the low, middle and high income voters in total turnout. The majority of total voters (**68%**) were in households making **less than $50,000 annually**.

![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1b6852eb-2688-446a-ab4a-bf3f4f0d312f_982x575.png)

The change over Clinton’s eight years in office was dramatic with the lowest-income voters **dropping 15%** in their share of votes. Suddenly, there were nearly as many voters below the $50,000 threshold and above. The lowest-income bracket lost their dominance and would never regain it.

## Inequality

Inequality was ingrained in the election by the time another Clinton ran in 2016. The Democrats gave up on low income city dwellers and blue-collar workers, choosing to harness just enough votes to pull off the electoral win with upper-middle class and upper class suburbanites.

![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4549952e-5b79-4056-9acc-68ab5cd4ccba_1440x960.jpeg)

Whether the poorer voters left the party or were pushed out, what is clear now is that the Democrats have no desire to regain them and shift the balance back towards the poor and their political desires.

“For every blue-collar Democrat we lose in western Pennsylvania, we will pick up two moderate Republicans in the suburbs in Philadelphia, and you can repeat that in Ohio and Illinois and Wisconsin.”

A look at 2016 voters (purple) and nonvoters (blue) shows how stark the income voting gap is. Over half of nonvoters are in households making less than $30,000 a year.

![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f3b7222-2662-4fb1-9dc4-dd32bbd6ecc9_982x242.png)

And the divide isn’t just on income. In 2016 voters of color made up **15% of all votes**cast, but they made up nearly **half** of the eligible voters who did not participate.

![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fedb51640-12e1-49f3-ad2e-0c7b87ce77e7_654x199.png)

With a voting pool overrepresented by white, high income voters it’s no wonder that it constantly feels like policies that are incredibly popular are always left by the wayside at election time. The same people demanding Medicare for All and marching in the street for racial justice are not the ones casting votes (See: Sanders, Bernie).

## Progress

[Until recently, the consensus held that voters and non-voters were carbon copies on policy preference. But research looking across 30 years and](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fedb51640-12e1-49f3-ad2e-0c7b87ce77e7_654x199.png) [summarized by Demos](https://www.demos.org/research/why-voting-gap-matters)shows that nonvoters are far more progressive in their views.

They want a more active government with higher taxes. As far back as 2007, a majority of nonvoters thought the government should provide health care according to research for the book _[Who Votes Now](https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691159355/who-votes-now)_. Registered voters wouldn’t reach that point for nearly another decade.

![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa56ae5ab-fa1e-4e5d-8391-9841a5a9b72d_561x720.png)

How do we get these nonvoters to the polls?

1.  Increase union membership;
2.  Reduce barriers to voting with policies like automatic registration at age 18 and same-day registration;
3.  Promote policies that better the lives of low income people;
4.  **Money**. Like the answer to most issues when it comes to inequality — money is the most straightforward solution.

[One study looked at populations that saw a sudden influx of cash. In](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa56ae5ab-fa1e-4e5d-8391-9841a5a9b72d_561x720.png) [one case](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2018/10/25/a-story-from-this-american-indian-reservation-has-important-lessons-for-americas-voter-turnout-problem/), Native Americans received relatively small yearly payments when a casino opened. An increase in household income of **$4700** had no impact on the voting patterns of parents receiving the money, but their children ultimately **voted at rates 8-20% higher**than counterparts who didn’t receive the transfer.

## Policy

The energy may feel like it’s with bold policy initiatives (well, it is), but the reliable, or at least desired votes are with those who do not actually want fundamental changes. Shrewd campaign operatives know this and if they can ride out some social media attacks they will be able to steer their candidate straight down the center, picking up a few suburban voters in their minivan to victory.

And that’s why you feel a constant disconnect from what everyone is demanding and what politicians are offering. It’s how a candidate who promoted segregation and a former prosecutor end up soundly rejecting protestors’ demands to “Defund the Police” in their first joint interview. Joe didn’t just reject it, he said we need to give police forces more money.

## Base

Congressperson Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez rightly pointed out where the party was aiming its appeal in summarizing the convention.

She said, “**The target audience for this convention was white moderates…**” She’s right.

![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb9dbbe4f-da68-4429-a0e3-833e648369be_1128x1946.jpeg)

Where she is wrong though is in calling for an appeal to the party’s “base.” That appeal to white moderates is an appeal to the party’s base. Biden’s VP choice clarifies the wide gap between the perceived Democratic base and the real base.

[We are in the midst of the greatest health crisis in a century, and consider that Biden’s biggest recent political action was to pick a running mate who backed out of her support of Medicare for All. Kamala Harris was one of the first co-sponsors of the Sanders’ penned bill, but](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb9dbbe4f-da68-4429-a0e3-833e648369be_1128x1946.jpeg) [withdrew her support](https://www.newsweek.com/kamala-harris-healthcare-medicare-all-bernie-sanders-1455106) while surrounded by wealthy donors in the Hamptons.

We are in the midst of the biggest uprising against state violence and injustice in a generation and Biden chose a prosecutor who first won office calling the incumbent, “Soft on crime.” One example of that prosecutor’s weak record [according to Harris](https://www.sfweekly.com/news/kamalas-karma/) was his release of 400 anti-Iraq war protestors. As California AG her colleagues say that their cries of “Black Lives Matter” and push for equality in the justice system were met with “[silence](https://newrepublic.com/article/159005/kamala-harris-dnc-speech-prosecutor-record-crime)” from Harris.

## Product

Democratic leadership has claimed since the 1990s that centrist, pro-wealthy policies were key to engineering national victories. But at some point we have to start wondering if the policies are the product, not the byproduct. Perhaps it is less that centrist policy is needed to win votes, but wanted by those directing strategy.

Just look at Medicare for All, a policy that now enjoys broad support from all registered voters with the exception of the GOP.

[M4A is supported by **57% of all registered voters, 8 in 10** registered Democrats and even 61% of Independents according to the](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe9a57326-1772-47f6-8cbc-ccd87b9779e7_982x752.png) [Kaiser Family Foundation](https://www.kff.org/slideshow/public-opinion-on-single-payer-national-health-plans-and-expanding-access-to-medicare-coverage/). It was still ejected by party elite from the DNC platform with a [125-36 vote](https://www.salon.com/2020/07/28/dnc-platform-committee-votes-to-reject-medicare-for-all-despite-overwhelming-support-from-voters/).

A 2012 poll found that nonvoters favored [Obama over Romney](https://www.politico.com/story/2012/08/poll-obama-leads-among-non-voters-079758) by a whopping **23%**. Going after those voters is a strategy for long-term election dominance and sweeping progressive change if that’s what Democrats actually want.

## Transformation

But they do not. Rahm Emmanual, who engineered House Democratic victories with moderate, ‘Blue Dog Democrats,’ sees promise in the rejection of the Green New Deal and Medicare for All by the party apparatus. He [told CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/21/this-will-be-the-year-of-the-biden-republican-rahm-emanuel-says.html):

> This will be the year of the Biden Republican

Moreover, Emmanuel, sees this as the completion of the “Transformation” of the Democratic Party with a large influx of wealthy, moderate Republicans he hopes will stay.

Bill Clinton was willing to see turnout plummet to excise poor voters and 20 years later the transformation is complete. This is the new reality unless a similarly concerted project is undertaken to bring the most marginalized back to the polls. For now, they remain on the margins.
